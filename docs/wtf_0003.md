# Questions

This file should be used to jot down questions I have while working on this project.

This is useful for when I'm working on a user story and I encounter something that doesn't make
sense, or that I'd like to understand better. I can make a note of it here, and ignore it until I'm
done working on said user story, coming back to it once I've completed the story.

### Basic Django app: Tutorial #3

1. What's the difference between WSGI and ASGI?
   (See [Difference between WSGI and ASGI ?](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/difference-between-wsgi-and-asgi-807158ed1d4c)

2. How does the `kwargs` parameter of `django.urls.path` function work?
   (See [django.urls functions for use in URLconfs paths()](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/urls/#django.urls.path)
   and [Passing extra options to view functions](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/http/urls/#views-extra-options))

3. The Django `settings.py` file implies that you can have non-default databases. How so?
   (See [Database setup](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial02/#database-setup))

4. What's the deal with the CockroachDB and Firebird databases?
   (See: [Using a 3rd-party database backend](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/databases/#third-party-notes))

5. I'm guessing that `BASE_DIR` should eventually be changed and set to an environment variable
   so that the DB location can be controlled using tooling?
   (See: [Using a 3rd-party database backend](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/databases/#third-party-notes))
 
6. When setting a database other than the default SQLite implementation, how do you set the
   "create databases" privileges for a `USER`?
   (See: [Using a 3rd-party database backend](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/databases/#third-party-notes))
 
7. What are some other Field types that Django can use (e.g. DateTimeField)?
   (See [Field API reference](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.Field))

8. What's the deal with the `ForeignKey` data model?
   (See [Relationship fields ForeignKey](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ForeignKey))

9. What's the deal with the `manage.py` Django utility?
   (See [django-admin and manage.py](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/django-admin/))

10. How does Python handle time zones?  (See [Time zones](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/i18n/timezones/))

11. What are some useful double underscore builtin keywords to use for field lookups?
   (See [Field lookups](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/db/queries/#field-lookups-intro))

12. How does Django automatically build up data model relations?
   (See [Related objects reference](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/models/relations/))

13. What's the deal with Django's database API? (See [Making queries](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/db/queries/))

14. How are URLconf's represented in the code structure of Django? (Pop the hood and find out!)
    (See [URL dispatcher](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/http/urls/))

15. Examine the generated Django 500 error page by incorrectly mapping a URL capture on an app
    view (e.g. `path('<int:question_rd>/vote/', views.vote, name='vote'),`).
   (See [Writing your first Django app, part 3](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial03/))

16. What defaults does `<!DOCTYPE html>` import, again? Can't remember.

17. Create an Anki card for `django.shortcuts.render`.

18. What the heck does this mean?

   "The `get_object_or_404()` function takes a Django model as its first argument and an
   arbitrary number of keyword arguments, which it passes to the `get()` function of the
   model’s manager. It raises Http404 if the object doesn’t exist."

   See [A shortcut: get_object_or_404()](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial03/#a-shortcut-get-object-or-404)

19. What's up with Django [Templates](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/templates/)?

20. The Django tutorial provided the following statement:

    "The problem with this hardcoded, tightly-coupled approach is that it becomes challenging to
    change URLs on projects with a lot of templates. However, since you defined the name
    argument in the `path()` functions in the `polls.urls` module, you can remove a reliance on
    specific URL paths defined in your url configurations by using the `{% url %}` template tag"
 
    Why can the second line replace the first?
 
    ```html
    <!-- Original line -->
    <li><a href="/polls/{{ question.id }}/"><b>{{question.question_text }}</b></a></li>
 
    <!-- Refactored line -->
    <li><a href="{% url 'detail' question.id %}"><b>{{question.question_text }}</b></a></li>
    ```
 
    See [Removing hardcoded URLs in templates](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial03/#removing-hardcoded-urls-in-templates)

21. In [Writing your first Django app, part 4](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial04/), the text says:

    "Always return an `HttpResponseRedirect` after successfully dealing with POST data. This
    prevents data from being posted twice if a user hits the Back button."
 
    Why is this?

22. Django provides the `request.POST` and `request.GET` objects for accessing HTTP data. What
    does look like under the hood?
   (See [Write a minimal form](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial04/#write-a-minimal-form))

23. What's the deal with the `django.urls.reverse` method?
   (See [reverse](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/urlresolvers/#django.urls.reverse))
   
24. What's going on with Request and Response objects and how do they relate to `HttpRequest`
    and `HttpResponseRedirect` objects in Django?
   (See [Request and response objects](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/request-response/))

25. The [Writing your first Django app, part 4](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial04/#writing-your-first-django-app-part-4)
    page says:

    "The code for our `vote()` view does have a small problem. It first gets the `selected_choice`
    object from the database, then computes the new value of votes, and then saves it back to
    the database. If two users of your website try to vote at exactly the same time, this might
    go wrong: The same value, let’s say 42, will be retrieved for votes. Then, for both users
    the new value of 43 is computed and saved, but 44 would be the expected value."
 
    This is called a _race condition_. If you are interested, you can read
    [Avoiding race conditions using `F()`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/models/expressions/#avoiding-race-conditions-using-f)
    to learn how you can solve this issue.
 
    Read about how to solve this problem and fix the bug in the code.

26. How do generic views work?
   (See [Use generic views: Less code is better](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial04/#use-generic-views-less-code-is-better) and
   [Class-based views](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/class-based-views/))

27. How does `django.test.TestCase.contains` capture raw text?
   (See [Testing our new view](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial05/#testing-our-new-view))

28. Add Django-based user stories based on the following sections:

    - [Ideas for more tests](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial05/#ideas-for-more-tests)
    - [When testing, more is better](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial05/#when-testing-more-is-better)
    - [Further testing](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial05/#when-testing-more-is-better)

29. What's the deal with static files in Django?
   (See [Managing static files (e.g. images, JavaScript, CSS)](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/howto/static-files/))

30. How does Django find and load its templates? (See [`django.template.loader`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/templates/#template-loading))

31. See [Customize the admin index page](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial07/#customize-the-admin-index-page)
    to customize the index page of the admin site.

32. Add some user stories based on [Django: What to read next](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/whatsnext/#what-to-read-next).

33. Add a user story for [Django: Advanced tutorial: How to write reusable apps](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/reusable-apps/#advanced-tutorial-how-to-write-reusable-apps).

34. Add a user story for integrating a production web server into Django.

35. What's the deal with [Django settings](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/settings/)?
