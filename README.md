# webdavis.io

This repo tracks the build of my personal website webdavis.io. The idea of this project is to build
multiple versions of this site using a different Python webframework for each version, and
track them all in this repo.

I'm not really sure if it's a good idea to track all of the builds in one repo, so that
being said, this project may split into many different repos as some point.

## Python Web Frameworks

For a list of all of the Python web frameworks that I plan to use, see [webframeworks.io](./webframeworks.md).
